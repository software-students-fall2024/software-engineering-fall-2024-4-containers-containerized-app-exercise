# Containerized App Exercise

# Description

Sonus is a a speech-to-text application that allows the user to input speech through access to a microphone, as well as with an audio file. By providing more input, the application should become more accuracte wit its translation, as the machine learning client analyzes and keeps track of background noise!

2. Make sure to have docker-compose installed. <br>

3. Clone the repository by using the command: <br>
```git clone git@github.com:software-students-fall2024/4-containers-scoobygang2.git``` <br>

4. Navigate into the project root folder.

5. To run the app, use the command: <br>
```docker-compose up --build``` <br>

Or run in detatched mode: <br>
```docker-compose up -d``` <br>

6. To view the app, go to http://localhost:3000/. <br>

7. To shut down the containers, run the command: <br>
```docker-compose down``` <br>

# How to Run Tests the Machine Learning Client

1. Navigate into the machine-learning-client directory by using the command: <br>
```cd machine-learning-client``` <br>

2. Set up a virtual environment, by using the commands:
```pip3 install pipenv OR pip install pipenv``` <br>

3. Activate the virtual environment: <br>
```pipenv shell``` <br>

4. To run tests, use the command:
```python3 -m pytest```

# How to Run Tests the Web Application
1. Navigate into web-app directory by using the command: <br>
```cd web-app``` <br>

2. Set up a virtual environment, by using the commands:
```pip3 install pipenv OR pip install pipenv``` <br>

3. Activate the virtual environment: <br>
```pipenv shell``` <br>

4. To run tests, use the command:
```python3 -m pytest```

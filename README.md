# Containerized App Exercise

Build a containerized app that uses machine learning. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Overview
Voice Journal is a hands free, online journal that allows user to create entries by speaking. These entries are transcribed and analyzed to be positive, neutral, or negative in tone in order to provide the user with metrics about their mood over time.

## How to Run the Project through Docker
#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed:
```bash
python3 --version
```

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/4-containers-java-and-the-scripts-1.git
    ```

2. **Enter the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd 4-containers-java-and-the-scripts-1
    ```
    
3. **Start and build the docker containers**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --force-recreate --build
    ```
    
4. **Access the application**
    The application can be used locally at http://localhost:5002.

5. **Shut down the Docker containers**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
## How to Run Unit Tests
We've included unit tests for each function in the main.py and utils.py. To run these tests:

1. Install `pytest` in the virtual environment and `coverage`:
    ```bash
    pipenv install pytest
    pipenv install coverage
    ```
2. Run the tests from the main project directory:
    ```bash
    python3 -m pytest
    ```
3. Use the `coverage` tool to ensure the code achieves at least 80% test coverage
    ```bash
    pipenv run coverage run -m pytest
    pipenv run coverage report
    ```
4. Verify all tests pass to ensure correct functionality.

    - **main.py tests**: These tests focus on the backend functionality such as `main()` and `setup_logging()`, ensuring the correct interaction with external systems like MongoDB and file handling.
    
    - **utils.py tests**: These tests cover the utility functions like `get_audio_files()`, `transcribe_audio()`, `analyze_sentiment()`, and `store_data()`, validating tasks like file handling, API interaction, sentiment analysis, and database operations.
  
## Functions Overview

- **get_audio_files(directory: str) -> list**  
    - **Description**: Retrieves a list of `.wav` audio files from the specified directory.  
    - **Parameters**:  
      - `directory`: The path to the directory containing audio files.  
    - **Returns**: A list of paths to `.wav` audio files.  
    - **Example**:  
      ```python
      get_audio_files("./uploads")
      # Output: ['./uploads/file1.wav', './uploads/file2.wav']
      ```
---

- **transcribe_audio(file_path: str) -> str**  
    - **Description**: Transcribes the audio file at the given path into text.  
    - **Parameters**:  
      - `file_path`: The path to the audio file.  
    - **Returns**: The transcribed text from the audio file. Returns an empty string if transcription fails.  
    - **Example**:  
      ```python
      transcribe_audio("./uploads/audio1.wav")
      # Output: "This is a transcription of the audio file."
      ```

---

- **analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> dict**  
    - **Description**: Analyzes the sentiment of the provided text using TextBlob.  
    - **Parameters**:  
      - `text`: The text to analyze.  
    - **Returns**: A dictionary with keys:  
      - `polarity`: A float (-1 to 1) indicating sentiment polarity.  
      - `subjectivity`: A float (0 to 1) indicating subjectivity.  
      - `mood`: A string ("Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral") based on polarity.  
    - **Example**:  
      ```python
      analyze_sentiment("This is amazing!")
      # Output: {'polarity': 0.9, 'subjectivity': 0.8, 'mood': 'Positive'}
      ```

---

- **store_data(collection, data: dict) -> None**  
    - **Description**: Stores the provided data in the specified MongoDB collection.  
    - **Parameters**:  
      - `collection`: The MongoDB collection where the data will be stored.  
      - `data`: A dictionary containing transcription and sentiment analysis results.  
    - **Returns**: None. Logs a success message when storage is successful.  
    - **Example**:  
      ```python
      data = {
          "user_id": "123",
          "file_name": "audio1.wav",
          "transcript": "This is amazing!",
          "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.9, "subjectivity": 0.8, "mood": "Positive"},
          "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
      }
      store_data(collection, data)
      # Output: Logs "Data stored successfully."
      ```

## Notes

This project is meant to be run on Google Chrome (other modern browsers should work as well). It will not work as intended on a browser such as Safari. Additionally, for aaccurate transcription, please wait 10 seconds between uploading the recordings.

## Continuous Integration

This project has a continuous integration workflow that builds and runs unit tests automatically with every push to GitHub.

## DESCRIPTION

Our containerized web application is designed to play an interactive game of Rock-Paper-Scissors with the user by utilizing machine learning for image recognition. Built with scalability and modularity in mind, the app leverages Docker to containerize the application, making deployment and management straightforward across different environments.

Key Features:

	1.	Image Recognition with Machine Learning:
	•	The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to recognize hand gestures (rock, paper, or scissors) via the user’s webcam or uploaded image.
	•	The model processes images in real-time to identify the user’s choice and compares it with the computer’s randomly generated choice to determine the winner.
	2.	Web-Based User Interface:
	•	The application provides an intuitive and responsive web interface that guides users through the game.
	•	Users can easily play the game directly from their web browser without needing to install any additional software.
	•	Real-time feedback is provided, with visual cues showing the user’s move, the computer’s move, and the outcome of each round.

# Containerized App Exercise

Build a containerized app that uses machine learning. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Description

Our project is an audio-based recognition system for activity. It's designed to analyze various sound events, such as clapping, snapping, and hitting a desk and classify them accordingly. The system leverages Docker for scalability, and operates in a containerized environment, as per the instructions.

# Acknowledgements

- The structure of docker-compose.yaml and our Dockerfile are based on the examples we were given in class (https://knowledge.kitchen/content/courses/software-engineering/notes/containers/)
- When writing the tests, these sources were helpful to figure out mocking, Flask config testing, and mostly just how the assertions should look
